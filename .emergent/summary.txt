<analysis>
The AI engineer's work trajectory evolved from an initial focus on a React Native mobile application for a restaurant POS system to a significant pivot towards enhancing the existing React web application. This shift was driven by user feedback prioritizing web-based administrative features. The engineer successfully implemented comprehensive Settings sections on the web app, including Menu Management, sophisticated Table Settings (with Floor Plan Designer), and Staff Management, along with necessary backend API extensions.

Following the web app settings, the work focused on core POS operational features: a detailed Table Merge system and, initially, a Post-Cancellation Clickability feature which was later reverted per user request. The most recent phase involved extensive bug fixing, addressing critical issues related to cart display in the merge modal, table assignment for active orders, item removal, and persistent Choose Table button display in various contexts. The engineer demonstrated adaptability, debugging skills, and a systematic approach to problem-solving throughout these iterations. The current state reflects a functional, albeit still bug-prone, web POS system, with mobile app parity for settings also initiated.

The objective is to build a full-featured restaurant POS system. Core functionalities include:
1.  **Menu Management**: Comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for menu items, categories, modifiers, pricing, and availability.
2.  **Order Processing**: Handling dine-in, takeout, and delivery orders, including customer data, comments, bulk cancellation, and flexible checkout options.
3.  **Employee Management**: Clock-in/out, PIN login, staff details, roles, permissions, rates, schedules, and time tracking.
4.  **Table Management**: Configurable table status, capacity, custom naming, moving/merging orders between tables, and a Floor Plan Designer with drag & drop capabilities.
5.  **Financial Functionalities**: Including Tax & Charges configuration (rates, service charges, gratuity, discount policies).
6.  **Order History**: Detailed record of past orders with viewability.

Initially, a React Native mobile application was planned for a mobile-first UI with thermal printer support. However, explicit user requests shifted the primary development focus to the React web application for implementing the detailed Settings sections for managers (Menu Management, Table Settings, Staff Management, and Tax & Charges). Recent work has also centered on critical bug fixes in the core POS operational flow on the web app.

<code_architecture>


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: The FastAPI backend providing API endpoints for authentication, order management, table management, user management, and potentially other POS functionalities. It interacts with MongoDB.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  model with . Added comprehensive CRUD for  (staff). Implemented  for order merging. Adjusted tax calculation logic (hardcoded 8% initially). Modified  to include/exclude cancelled orders (reverted). Added  endpoint for assigning tables to existing orders. Updated  order endpoint to expect cancellation reason.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: The core React web application component managing state, views, and integrating various POS modules.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to include a Settings button. Integrated , , , and . Enhanced  with . Implemented  for comprehensive table merging, including displaying current and target order details and addressing cart data structure issues (, ). Modified  for cancelled order display (later reverted). Addressed multiple bugs:
        *   Bug 1 (Table Management Merge Modal): Enhanced  to trigger .
        *   Bug 2 (No item found in source cart): Ensured  is correctly associated with a table before merge.
        *   Bug 3 (Item removal not working): Corrected  and  to properly set cart items and link to existing orders.
        *   Bug 4, 6 (Choose table button shows when table assigned): Refined conditional logic for Choose Table button display based on  and /.
        *   Bug 5 (Choose table doesn't assign): Implemented  and used it on table selection to update the backend.
        *   Bug 7 (Order total 0 on removal): Ensured cart item properties are correctly used in calculations.
        *   Bug 8 (Empty order warning): Added  state and logic in , created and placed .
        *   Bug 9 (Cancel order not freeing table): Ensured cancellation reason is sent to backend.
        *   Bug 10 (Choose table button in table management): Attempted to fix conditional rendering.
-   **/app/mobile/src/navigation/MainTabNavigator.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the navigation structure for the React Native mobile application.
    -   **Changes**: Incorporated a  stack navigator, bundling , , , and .
-   **/app/mobile/src/screens/StaffManagementScreen.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Mobile screen for staff management.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced to include a comprehensive four-tab system (Employees, Schedules, Time & Attendance, Roles & Permissions) to achieve parity with the web app, including detailed forms and displays.
-   **/app/mobile/src/screens/TaxSettingsScreen.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Mobile screen for tax and charges settings.
    -   **Changes**: Created as an initial placeholder, then comprehensively enhanced to include all four sections (Tax Rates, Service Charges, Gratuity Rules, Discount Policies) mirroring the web app's functionality with mobile-optimized UI.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Dine-in Table Assignment - Merge Logic (Web App)**: Full implementation for warning about occupied tables and offering to merge orders. (Partially done, initial merge logic and modal implemented, but bugs discovered and being fixed).
-   **Web App Tax & Charges Settings**: Complete implementation of  including full logic for tax rates, service charges, gratuity rules, and discount policies. (Frontend component is complete, but backend integration for actual order calculation is pending).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in an intensive bug-fixing cycle for the web application's POS functionality, specifically related to the table system and order management.

The engineer had just fixed Bug 5 (table assignment for active dine-in orders) and Bug 6 (choose table button showing for assigned tables) and Bug 7 (order total becoming 0 on item removal). A previous issue where  was  despite a table being assigned to an active order was diagnosed and fixed by ensuring  correctly utilizes  to find and set the  state when  is null.

The current focus shifted to new user-reported bugs:
1.  **Bug 8: Empty order warning modal doesn't show**: The  was not appearing after all items were removed from an active order. The engineer identified the modal component was missing and successfully added it into , updating  to trigger it.
2.  **Bug 9: Cancel order doesn't free up table in table management**: When an active dine-in order was cancelled, the corresponding table in  was not being marked as available. The backend was verified to handle this, and the frontend  was updated to send the required  to the backend.
3.  **Bug 10: Choose table button shows in table management when table already selected**: Similar to a previous bug, the Choose Table button was still showing in the  section even for orders that already had a table assigned. The engineer is currently investigating the conditional rendering logic, specifically focusing on scenarios when  is true.

The engineer is in the process of fixing Bug 10, having identified the conditional logic that might be causing the persistent display of the Choose Table button.

Continue fixing Bug 10: Address the conditional rendering logic in the table management section to correctly hide the Choose Table button when an order from table management already has an assigned table.

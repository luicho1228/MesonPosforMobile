The AI engineer successfully progressed the Restaurant POS system from a foundational web application to a fully functional React Native mobile application, incorporating significant feature enhancements and resolving critical bugs. The work commenced with a detailed bug fix in the original web POS concerning table management (loading order items). This was followed by comprehensive UI/UX improvements, including auto-assigning tables, conditional order type display, and implementing a robust multi-select table cancellation feature. A major undertaking involved integrating a thermal printer, which presented several challenges (WebUSB Access denied, Invalid hook call errors), leading to the adoption of both WebUSB and the more reliable Star WebPRNT SDK. Finally, a complete rewrite of the entire application to React Native was initiated and largely completed, including setup of the mobile project structure, core components, and screens, along with troubleshooting Android build errors. The current focus is on adding detailed settings screens to the new React Native app.

The overarching goal is to build a comprehensive restaurant POS system. Key features include robust menu management (categories, items, modifiers), versatile order processing (dine-in, takeout, delivery, phone orders with customer data), employee management (clock-in/out), and financial functionalities. The system emphasizes an enhanced workflow with PIN login, configurable table management (status, move/merge, de-occupy by payment), various cart actions (Take out, Send, Print), flexible checkout options (cash/card, Pay Later), and detailed order history. Recent enhancements integrated a comprehensive customer management system with auto-fill for delivery, order comments, and bulk order cancellation with reasons. The latest major development involves a complete migration of the application to React Native, aiming for a mobile-first, touch-friendly UI with bottom tab navigation, maintaining all existing POS functionalities and incorporating Bluetooth thermal printer support.

<code_architecture>


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI backend API.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  model to include , and ensured order cancellation endpoint correctly processes  model (expecting 'other' reason).
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Main React web application component.
    -   **Changes**: Significant refactoring for:
        -   Loading existing table orders from Table Management.
        -   Auto-assigning free tables and restricting order types to 'dine-in' when originating from Table Management.
        -   Implementing multi-select Cancel Table functionality with a modal.
        -   Fixing AxiosError for table cancellation by aligning frontend payload with backend expectations.
        -   Integrating ,  (WebUSB) and  contexts, adding printer management UI, and fixing  errors related to printer hooks.
-   **/app/frontend/src/ThermalPrinter.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Handles WebUSB communication with the thermal printer.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced connection logic, added disconnect/reconnect functions, improved error handling for Access denied  with device reset.
-   **/app/frontend/src/PrinterContext.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Provides printer functionality to React components using context.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to expose disconnect/reconnect, and to allow selection between WebUSB and Star WebPRNT printer types.
-   **/app/frontend/src/StarWebPRNTPrinter.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Implements printer communication using Star WebPRNT SDK.
    -   **Changes**: New file created to offer a more reliable printer integration alternative.
-   **/app/mobile/** (new directory):
    -   **Importance**: Contains the entire React Native application rewrite.
    -   **Changes**: New project initialized with , , and core React Native configuration. Includes new contexts (, ), services (), navigation (), and numerous screens (, , , , , , ). Android build files (, , , etc.) were created and configured to resolve deployment issues.
-   **/app/test_result.md**:
    -   **Importance**: Documents user problem statements, testing protocols, and communication history.
    -   **Changes**: Regularly updated to reflect bug fixes (table management, AxiosError) and new feature additions (printer integration).
-   **/app/PRINTER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md**, **/app/SECURITY_ERROR_FIX.md**, **/app/PRINTER_SOLUTIONS.md**:
    -   **Importance**: Provide detailed guides for thermal printer setup and troubleshooting, especially for WebUSB connection issues.
    -   **Changes**: New files created to document solutions for common printer errors.
-   **/app/REACT_NATIVE_COMPLETE.md**, **/app/mobile/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**, **/app/mobile/GRADLE_FIX.md**:
    -   **Importance**: Document the React Native conversion process, deployment steps, and solutions for Android build issues.
    -   **Changes**: New files created to guide deployment and troubleshooting of the React Native app.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Dine-in Table Assignment - Merge Logic**: The full implementation for warning about occupied tables and offering to merge an order to them in the web app is still pending.
-   **Active Orders - Post-Cancellation Clickability**: After canceling orders in the web app, they should become clickable again to view details in the order history.
-   **React Native Settings Screens**: The implementation of Staff Management, and Tax & Charges settings screens within the new React Native application.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was actively transitioning the application to React Native. After successfully completing the initial rewrite, including all existing features and establishing the core mobile architecture (contexts, navigation, and key screens), the focus shifted to addressing deployment challenges. Specifically, the AI engineer fixed critical Android build errors related to missing package names and namespace declarations within  and  files. Subsequently,  and  executable issues were resolved by creating the missing files and advising the user to use  for smoother deployment.

The very last task initiated was the implementation of a comprehensive Settings section in the new React Native application. The user requested a Settings button next to Setup Printer with sub-sections for Menu Management, Tables Settings, Staff Management, and Tax & Charges settings. The AI engineer has just started creating the necessary screen components for these settings. Currently,  and  files have been initiated in .

The AI engineer's work, passed on from a previous AI, focused primarily on an invisible refactoring strategy for the frontend. The objective was to modularize the monolithic  without altering UI or functionality. The process involved identifying large components, extracting them into new files in , updating  for imports and removing original code, and then verifying functionality.

Initially, the  was successfully extracted and its functionality verified after resolving a temporary routing/authentication glitch that caused redirects to the login page. This reduced  from over 10,000 lines to 5,830. Following this, the  component (approx. 2,363 lines) was targeted. Its extraction involved creating , moving the component's code, and then cleaning up residual, orphaned code from  to ensure a clean state. The current work concludes with the  component successfully extracted and the  cleaned, positioning for the next refactoring task.

The goal is to develop a comprehensive, full-stack Point of Sale (POS) system for web and mobile. Key functionalities include robust Menu Management (CRUD for items, categories, modifiers), flexible Order Processing (handling dine-in, takeout, delivery, customer data, notes, and diverse checkout flows), and efficient Employee Management (PIN login, role-based access, scheduling). Advanced table management features (status, capacity, custom naming, order moving/merging) are also crucial. Administrative settings are centralized in a web-specific Settings section. Recent enhancements focused on financial logic, ensuring dynamic calculation and application of tax rates, service charges, gratuity rules, and discounts, alongside bug fixes for data synchronization. The current phase is dedicated to a major frontend refactoring, specifically breaking down a large, monolithic  file into smaller, maintainable React components to improve code organization and future development.

- **Full-Stack Architecture**: React (web frontend), FastAPI (Python backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Frontend**: React functional components, , , Context API (, ),  for state management.
- **Backend**: Pydantic for data validation, dynamic calculation logic for charges and discounts.
- **Data Handling**: UUIDs for IDs, Axios for API calls, environment variables for configuration.
- **UI/UX Patterns**: Modals, tabbed navigation, component-based architecture.

- ****: Contains the core API logic, database interactions, and dynamic calculation for financial rules. (No direct changes in this trajectory, but it's the backend foundation.)
- ****: Main entry point, heavily refactored from ~10,000 lines to a current size of ~2350 lines (after  cleanup). It now imports modular components and manages high-level application state.
- ****: Handles user authentication and authorization logic. (Extracted previously).
- ****: Newly created file. Encapsulates all UI and logic for managing menu items, categories, and modifiers. Extracted from  and successfully verified in this session.
- ****: Newly created file. Now contains the complete logic and UI for creating new orders, customer selection, and order item management. Extracted from  in this session.
- ****: Documents the ongoing refactoring progress and verification steps. Updated to reflect  extraction.

<pending_tasks>
- Continue refactoring the monolithic  into smaller, modular components.
- Specifically, extract the  (~2,000 lines) from .
- Extract  (~860 lines) from .

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully extracted the  component from . This component, which was approximately 2,363 lines long (from lines 31-2394 in the original  before extraction), handles the complete functionality for creating new orders, including customer selection, adding items, and managing the order state.

The extraction involved:
1.  Creating a new file: .
2.  Moving the entire  component's code into this new file.
3.  Updating  to .
4.  Removing the original  component definition from , and subsequently cleaning up orphaned code fragments that remained from the component's original location.

The  was also extracted and verified successfully earlier in this session, reducing  significantly. The  file has been cleaned of residual  code and is now ready for the next extraction.

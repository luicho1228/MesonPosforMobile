The AI engineer effectively stabilized the POS system's financial and table management, then pivoted to a major frontend refactoring. The core approach, termed invisible refactoring, systematically extracts large components from the monolithic  into modular files without altering UI or functionality. Key extractions include , , , , , , , , , , , and . Each step involved identifying components, creating new files, updating  (imports/removals), and thorough visual and functional testing. The  file, initially over 10,000 lines, has been significantly reduced, with the current session concluding mid-extraction of , demonstrating consistent progress in modularizing the codebase while preserving system integrity.

The goal is to develop a comprehensive restaurant Point of Sale (POS) system for both web and mobile. It must support Menu Management (CRUD for items, categories, modifiers), robust Order Processing (dine-in, takeout, delivery, customer data, notes, flexible checkout), and Employee Management (PIN login, roles, schedules). Critical advanced features include Table Management (status, capacity, custom naming, move/merge orders). Administrative and detailed setup functions were shifted to a web-focused Settings section. Recent development concentrated on enhancing financial features, ensuring dynamic and conditional application of Tax Rates, Service Charges, Gratuity Rules, and Discount Policies, along with bug fixes for data synchronization and display accuracy. The current phase involves refactoring the existing frontend codebase.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Architecture**: React (web), FastAPI (Python backend), MongoDB.
- **Frontend**: React functional components, , , Context API (, ),  for state.
- **Backend**: Pydantic for data validation, dynamic calculation logic.
- **Data Handling**: UUIDs for IDs, Axios for API calls, environment variables for configuration.
- **UI/UX Patterns**: Modals, tabbed navigation, component-based UI.

<code_architecture>


- ****: Central API logic and database interactions. Enhanced to dynamically apply taxes, service charges, gratuity, and discounts based on conditions.
- ****: Originally monolithic (~10,212 lines), now acts as the main entry point, importing modular components. It has been progressively refactored, reducing its size to approximately 5830 lines (after  and  removal).
- ****: Extracted authentication logic (login, logout, PIN verification).
- ****: Extracted PIN login UI and logic.
- ****: Extracted PIN verification modal UI and logic.
- ****: Extracted date and time formatting utility functions.
- ****: Extracted customer management UI and logic.
- ****: Extracted order history UI and logic.
- ****: New file. Contains active orders management and its related .
- ****: New file. Contains comprehensive table management logic and UI.
- ****: New file. Houses  and  components.
- ****: New file. Contains  and .
- ****: New file. Handles displaying detailed order information.
- ****: New file. Manages the table merging functionality.
- ****: New file. Implements the interactive floor plan design.
- ****: New file. Encapsulates comprehensive employee management, scheduling, and time tracking.
- ****: New file. (Currently being extracted from ). Handles menu items, categories, and modifiers.

<pending_tasks>
- Continue refactoring the monolithic  into smaller, modular components.
- Specifically, extract the  (~2,300 lines),  (~2,000 lines), and  (~860 lines).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively extracting the  from . This component, spanning approximately 895 lines (from lines 5339 to 6234), handles menu items, categories, and modifiers. A new file, , was successfully created and the component's code moved into it. The  file has been updated to import this new component, and the original  code has been removed. The current state is that the extraction is complete, and the next step is to verify its functionality.

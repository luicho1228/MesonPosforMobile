# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

RESULTS: ✅ CORE FUNCTIONALITY WORKING: 1) Created delivery order and sent to kitchen (becomes active order) ✓, 2) Successfully changed order type from delivery to dine-in with table assignment ✓, 3) Database order record properly updated with new order_type ('dine_in' not 'delivery') ✓, 4) Tax and service charges correctly recalculated for dine-in (service charges increased from $3.50 to $8.26) ✓, 5) Active orders endpoint returns updated order type correctly ✓, 6) Table assignment data properly stored in order record ✓. ⚠️ MINOR ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Order update endpoint (PUT /orders/{order_id}) doesn't automatically update table status to 'occupied' when assigning table to active order - requires manual table assignment via PUT /orders/{order_id}/table endpoint. However, this doesn't affect the core order type switching functionality which is working correctly."

After thorough backend testing, confirmed payment processing works correctly - all paid orders are properly stored with status 'paid'. Root cause identified: Frontend order history has default date filter set to 'today' with timezone mismatch between backend (EDT) and frontend (local timezone). Fixed by changing default date filter from 'today' to 'all' to show all orders regardless of timezone. This should resolve the issue of paid orders not appearing in order history."

Root cause: Frontend wasn't properly handling backend's EDT timezone timestamps. Fixed by implementing comprehensive timezone handling with helper functions (parseBackendTimestamp, formatLocalDate, formatLocalTime, formatLocalDateTime) that properly convert backend EDT timestamps to user's local timezone for display. Updated all timestamp displays, time calculations, and date filtering throughout the frontend to use proper timezone conversion. This should resolve all timestamp display and time calculation issues."

Successfully implemented the same empty order detection and warning modal for when users remove all items from an order while editing from Table Management. Changes include: 1) Added empty order detection in removeFromCart function for editingOrder scenario (when editing from Table Management), 2) Updated the empty order detection to properly reload the table order using the correct API endpoint (orders/{order_id} instead of tables/{table_id}/orders), 3) Enhanced cancelEmptyOrder function to handle navigation back to Table Management and refresh the table status, 4) Maintained the same professional Empty Order Warning Modal with options to Cancel Order or Keep Order for adding items later. The feature now provides consistent user experience across both NewOrder and Table Management contexts."

Root cause: The Active Orders component was using the old table_number field check and wasn't properly displaying table information for dine-in orders. Fix implemented: 1) Updated Active Orders display logic to show table names for all dine-in orders using order.order_type === 'dine_in' condition, 2) Enhanced getOrderTableDisplayName() function to handle the new table_name field from backend and provide better fallback logic, 3) Added 'Table Not Assigned' fallback for dine-in orders without table assignments, 4) Maintained proper display for delivery orders with customer addresses.

After thorough backend testing, confirmed payment processing works correctly - all paid orders are properly stored with status 'paid'. Root cause identified: Frontend order history has default date filter set to 'today' with timezone mismatch between backend (EDT) and frontend (local timezone). Fixed by changing default date filter from 'today' to 'all' to show all orders regardless of timezone. This should resolve the issue of paid orders not appearing in order history."

    message: "TIMEZONE HANDLING ISSUE FIXED: User reported order timestamps displaying incorrectly - orders showing wrong creation times (e.g., 7:00 AM when created at 3:00 AM) and incorrect 'time ago' calculations. Root cause: Frontend wasn't properly handling backend's EDT timezone timestamps. Fixed by implementing comprehensive timezone handling with helper functions (parseBackendTimestamp, formatLocalDate, formatLocalTime, formatLocalDateTime) that properly convert backend EDT timestamps to user's local timezone for display. Updated all timestamp displays, time calculations, and date filtering throughout the frontend to use proper timezone conversion. This should resolve all timestamp display and time calculation issues."

FINDINGS: 1) BUG CONFIRMED: Tables 2, 3, and 4 are currently occupied by cancelled orders from legacy data. 2) ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: These are old cancelled orders that were cancelled before the table cleanup logic was implemented (they have cancellation_info: None). 3) CURRENT ENDPOINT WORKING: The current cancel order endpoint (lines 1178-1183) DOES work correctly - new cancellations properly free tables. 4) DATA ANALYSIS: Found 53 cancelled orders total - 20 with table_id, 4 with table_number only, 29 with neither. 5) LEGACY vs NEW: Old cancelled orders lack table_id field and have no cancellation_info, while new cancellations have proper table_id and cancellation_info. CONCLUSION: The cancel order logic is working correctly for new cancellations, but legacy cancelled orders from before the fix still occupy tables. This is a data cleanup issue, not a code bug. The current implementation properly checks order.get('table_id') and frees tables correctly."

    message: "PHASE 2 PARTIALLY COMPLETED - TAX & CHARGES BACKEND INTEGRATION: Successfully implemented comprehensive backend API for Tax & Charges management including: 1) Complete data models for TaxRate, ServiceCharge, GratuityRule, DiscountPolicy with all required fields, 2) Full CRUD endpoints for all four categories with manager role access control, 3) Tax calculation endpoint for order processing, 4) Backend testing confirms all endpoints working correctly. Frontend integration attempted but encountered React build cache corruption causing persistent blank screen. Applied troubleshoot agent's cache clearing solution but frontend issues persist. Moving forward with table merge logic enhancement while frontend Tax & Charges integration remains pending."

    message: "COMPLETED DELIVERY ORDER CUSTOMER INFO PERSISTENCE TESTING: Successfully tested the specific issue described in the review request - delivery order customer information persistence. ✅ BACKEND DATA PERSISTENCE CONFIRMED: Created comprehensive test that verified the complete workflow: 1) DELIVERY ORDER WITH CUSTOMER INFO: Created delivery order with customer name, phone, and address, verified all fields properly stored, 2) SEND TO KITCHEN: Successfully sent order to kitchen (status: pending), 3) BACKEND DATA VERIFICATION: Confirmed customer information (customer_name, customer_phone, customer_address) is properly stored and retrievable via both individual order endpoint and active orders endpoint, 4) CUSTOMER CREATION: Verified automatic customer record creation and phone-based lookup functionality, 5) ORDER EDITING PERSISTENCE: Tested that customer info persists through order editing operations, 6) MULTIPLE ORDER TYPES: Verified delivery, takeout, and phone orders all properly store and retrieve customer information. CONCLUSION: The backend data persistence is working correctly - customer information is properly stored and available for all order types. The issue was in frontend state management (loadActiveOrder function not setting showCustomerInfo = true when loading orders with customer data), not backend data persistence. The backend provides all necessary customer data for the frontend to display properly."

    message: "❌ APARTMENT FIELD LOADING ISSUE CONFIRMED: Completed comprehensive testing of the apartment field loading issue as requested in the review. CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) ✅ CUSTOMER MODEL WORKS: Customer apartment field is properly implemented - customers can be created with apartment information and it persists correctly in phone lookups, 2) ❌ ORDER MODEL BROKEN: The Order model is NOT saving the customer_apartment field - when creating delivery orders with apartment information, the customer_apartment value is not being stored in the order record, 3) 🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The backend accepts customer_apartment in the API request but fails to persist it to the database. This is why when users go back to edit delivery orders from active orders, the apartment field appears empty. 4) 📋 VERIFICATION COMPLETE: Tested the exact scenario described - created delivery order with apartment info, sent to kitchen to make it active, retrieved via /api/orders/active endpoint, and confirmed apartment field is missing from the response. CONCLUSION: This is a backend data persistence issue, not a frontend display issue. The Order model needs to be fixed to properly save and return the customer_apartment field."

    message: "✅ DYNAMIC TAX & SERVICE CHARGES APPLICATION BUG FIX SUCCESSFULLY TESTED: Completed comprehensive testing of the critical bug fix where orders were being saved with hardcoded 8% tax instead of dynamic calculations. VERIFIED FIXES: 1) DYNAMIC TAX CALCULATION: Orders now use 12.25% total tax rate (8.25% NYC + 4% State), NOT hardcoded 8%. Test results: $51.96 subtotal → Expected tax: $6.37 (12.25%) ✓, Actual tax: $6.37 ✓, Old hardcoded: $4.16 (8%) ❌. 2) SERVICE CHARGES PROPERLY APPLIED: Large party charges (18%) for dine-in orders above $50, delivery fees ($3.50) for delivery orders, no charges for takeout orders. 3) CORRECT FIELD SEPARATION: Orders have separate 'tax' and 'service_charges' fields with proper values. 4) PROPER TOTAL CALCULATION: Total = subtotal + dynamic_taxes + service_charges + tip. 5) ORDER PERSISTENCE: Saved orders include correct dynamic calculations, verified by retrieving from database after sending to kitchen. 6) ACTIVE ORDERS ENDPOINT: Returns orders with proper tax/charge breakdown. 7) ORDER TYPE SPECIFICITY: Different order types apply appropriate rates. 8) CREATE & UPDATE FUNCTIONS: Both create_order and update_order work with dynamic calculations. The critical bug has been fixed - frontend display was correct, but backend storage now matches frontend calculations."

    message: "✅ ORDER TYPE SWITCHING BUG TESTING COMPLETED: Successfully tested the specific order type switching bug reported by user where changing active order from delivery to dine-in doesn't update properly. COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS: 1) ✅ DELIVERY TO DINE-IN SWITCHING: Created delivery order, sent to kitchen (active), then changed to dine-in with table assignment - order type correctly updated in database from 'delivery' to 'dine_in', 2) ✅ TAX/CHARGE RECALCULATION: Service charges properly recalculated when switching order types (delivery $3.50 → dine-in $8.26), confirming calculate_order_taxes_and_charges() function works correctly with new order_type, 3) ✅ DATABASE PERSISTENCE: Order record properly updated with new order_type, table_id, table_name, and recalculated totals, 4) ✅ ACTIVE ORDERS ENDPOINT: /api/orders/active correctly returns updated order type and table assignment data, 5) ✅ TABLE ASSIGNMENT DATA: Table ID and name properly stored in order record. ⚠️ MINOR BACKEND ISSUE: Order update endpoint (PUT /orders/{order_id}) doesn't automatically mark table as occupied - requires separate table assignment call. However, core order type switching and tax recalculation functionality is working correctly. The reported bug appears to be resolved in the backend."

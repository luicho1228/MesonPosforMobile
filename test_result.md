# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Added assignedTable state initialization with selectedTable. 2) DINE-IN ONLY MODE: When accessing menu through Table Management, now only shows dine-in option and locks order type. Added fromTableManagement prop and conditional rendering of order type selection. Shows 'Table Management Mode' indicator. 3) MULTI-SELECT CANCEL TABLES: Replaced single-table alert with proper multi-select interface. Users can now select multiple occupied tables and cancel them in bulk. Added new modals: table selection with checkboxes and confirmation modal showing selected tables. All three fixes implemented and integrated into existing Table Management workflow."

    message: "AXIOS ERROR FIX - ORDER CANCELLATION: User reported AxiosError when cancelling tables. Root cause identified: Frontend was sending invalid reason 'table_cancelled' to order cancel endpoint, but backend only accepts 'customer_canceled', 'wrong_order', or 'other'. Fixed by: 1) Changed reason from 'table_cancelled' to 'other' with descriptive notes 2) Updated updateTableStatus to properly set current_order_id to null when making table available. Backend testing confirmed fix works correctly - order cancellation and table status updates now function properly without errors."

    message: "COMPLETED TABLE MANAGEMENT BUG FIX TESTING: Successfully verified that the current_order_id field is now properly included in the Table model and returned by the /api/tables endpoint. Created a comprehensive test that verified the complete workflow: 1) current_order_id field exists in all table responses, 2) occupied tables have current_order_id populated with the correct order ID, 3) available tables have current_order_id set to null, 4) sending an order to kitchen properly sets the table status to occupied and populates current_order_id, 5) payment completion clears current_order_id from table, and 6) order cancellation clears current_order_id from table. All tests passed successfully, confirming the bug fix is working as expected. The frontend should now be able to load existing orders when clicking occupied tables."

    message: "COMPLETED ORDER CANCELLATION API FIX TESTING: Successfully verified that the order cancellation API now properly accepts 'other' as a valid reason value. Created a comprehensive test that verified the complete workflow: 1) Created a test menu item, table, and dine-in order, 2) Sent the order to kitchen which correctly set the table status to occupied and populated current_order_id, 3) Successfully cancelled the order using 'other' as the reason with custom notes 'Table X cancelled via table management', 4) Verified the order status changed to 'cancelled' with proper cancellation details recorded, 5) Confirmed the table status was automatically updated to 'available' with current_order_id set to null after cancellation, 6) Directly tested the table update endpoint to verify it properly handles setting current_order_id to null. All tests passed successfully, confirming that both the order cancellation endpoint and table update functionality are working correctly. The frontend should no longer encounter AxiosError when cancelling tables from Table Management."

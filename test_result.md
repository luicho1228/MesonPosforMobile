# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "Successfully tested the table assignment for active orders bug fix. Verified that: 1) The new /api/orders/{order_id}/table endpoint exists and works correctly, 2) Active dine-in orders without table assignment can be assigned to tables, 3) Order table_id and table_number are properly updated after assignment, 4) Table status is updated to occupied with correct current_order_id, 5) Error handling works for non-existent orders and tables (returns 404), 6) The complete workflow from order creation → send to kitchen → table assignment → payment works seamlessly. Created a dine-in order without table, sent it to kitchen (status: pending), successfully assigned it to table 33320, verified table status became occupied with the correct order ID, and completed payment to clean up."

The issue appears to be in the conditional logic on line 3331 where orderType === 'dine_in' && !fromTableManagement should hide the table selection section.

Root cause was: 1) When clicking occupied table from table management, selectedTable was set to null but assignedTable depended on selectedTable initialization, 2) Added additional conditional logic to ensure 'Choose Table' button never shows when fromTableManagement=true. Fix implemented: 1) Modified handleTableSelect to pass table info for both available AND occupied tables, 2) Enhanced conditional logic in NewOrder component to add extra safeguard against showing 'Choose Table' button when fromTableManagement=true, 3) Added 'Table Management Mode - Loading...' fallback display. Testing confirmed: ✅ Choose Table button correctly hidden, ✅ Table Management Mode indicator shows properly, ✅ Proper editing behavior for occupied tables."

FINDINGS: 1) BUG CONFIRMED: Tables 2, 3, and 4 are currently occupied by cancelled orders from legacy data. 2) ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: These are old cancelled orders that were cancelled before the table cleanup logic was implemented (they have cancellation_info: None). 3) CURRENT ENDPOINT WORKING: The current cancel order endpoint (lines 1178-1183) DOES work correctly - new cancellations properly free tables. 4) DATA ANALYSIS: Found 53 cancelled orders total - 20 with table_id, 4 with table_number only, 29 with neither. 5) LEGACY vs NEW: Old cancelled orders lack table_id field and have no cancellation_info, while new cancellations have proper table_id and cancellation_info. CONCLUSION: The cancel order logic is working correctly for new cancellations, but legacy cancelled orders from before the fix still occupy tables. This is a data cleanup issue, not a code bug. The current implementation properly checks order.get('table_id') and frees tables correctly."
